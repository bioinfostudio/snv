            # Does the coverage fit with the expectation?

        choices:
            - ~CORRECT~ Yes 
            - No

        answer_explanation: |

            * Yes the mean coverage of the region is >85x.

            * `thresholds.bed.gz` is a useful function to see if your coverage is
            uniform.

            * Another way is to compare the mean to the median. If both are quite
            different that means something is wrong in your coverage.

        question: |

            The [[choice1]] sample has a larger median insert size than the
            [[choice2]] sample.

        prompt: |

            {% include "markdowns/08_alignment_metrics.md" %}

            # Do you think the sample and the reference genome fit together?

        choices:
            - ~CORRECT~ Yes 
            - No

        answer_explanation: |

            Yes, 99% of the reads have been aligned.  
            Usually, we consider

            * A good alignment if > 85%
            * Reference assembly issues if [60-85]%
            * Probably a mismatch between sample and ref if < 60 %
