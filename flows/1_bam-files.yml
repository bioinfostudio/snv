            There are lots of possible different flags, let’s look at a few more

                samtools view alignment/normal/normal.sorted.bam | head -n 100

            Let’s take the last read, which looks properly paired and find its mate pair.

                    a)  Instead of using <b>head</b>, what unix command could we pipe the output to?
                    b)  Once we’ve found both reads, the command can be stopped by typing <b>CTRL-C</b>

            # CIGAR string

             Using the cigar string, what can we tell about the alignment of the mate pair?

        question: |

            The mate pair has a less convincing alignment with two insertions and
            [[choice1]] clipping reported.

            # Alignment information

            How might the alignment information from the original read be used by the aligner?

        question: |

            Even though the alignment of the mate pair is questionable the presence
            of it’s properly paired mate helps the aligner in deciding where to put
            the [[choice1]] certain read.

            How many reads mapped and unmapped were there?

            You can use **samtools** to filter reads as well.
