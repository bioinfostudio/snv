            # Pre-processing: Mark Duplicates

            What are duplicate reads?

        question: |

            [[choice1]] read pairs representing the [[choice2]] initial DNA fragment.

            # Pre-processing: Mark Duplicates

            What are they caused by?

        question: |

            [[blank1]] duplicates

            Some clusters that are thought of being separate in the flowcell but are the same ([[blank2]] duplicates)

        title: Duplicates detection 
        prompt: |

            # Pre-processing: Mark Duplicates

            What are the ways to detect them?

        question: |

            1. Picard and samtools uses the alignment positions

                Both 5â€™ ends of both reads need to have the same positions.

                Each reads have to be on the same [[blank1]] as well.

            2. Another method is to use a kmer approach

                Take a part of both ends of the fragment.

                Build a hash table.

                Count the similar hits.

            3. Brute force, compare all the sequences

        question: |

            1. What percent of reads are duplicates?
            
                [[blank1]]

            2. Often, we have multiple libraries and when this occurs separate measures are calculated for each library. Why is it important to not combine everything?

                Each library represents a set of [[choice1]] DNA fragments.

                Each library involves [[choice2]] PCR reactions

        answer_explanation: |

            PCR duplicates can not occur between fragments of two different
            libraries. However, similar fragments could be found between
            libraries when the coverage is high.
